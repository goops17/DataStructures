# Double Sixes - dice game (kinda like BlackJack)
### The game logic will play out like this:

1.  Computer asks for player’s name (1 – 5) (first name only for this game) store that as a player object.

2.  Each player will start with a wallet total of $500. (Player wins comes out of computer bank.  Starting value at $5000).

3.  Each player will then place their bet (make sure they don’t go over their current wallet value)

4.  Program will simulate computer’s throw of two dice.

5.  IF(computer throws two sixes) Player’s win that money – computer loses that money.

6.  ELSE computer gains all bets.  A bet of 0 from a player means they are not going to enter this round of play. (So they do not win or lose money for that round)

7.  Loop the simulation for as long as the players want to play, give them a way to stop the game after each round.

8.  After each round of play – display current wallet totals and bank total.
